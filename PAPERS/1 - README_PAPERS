# README of the PAPERS-Directory
--------------------------------

We have improved and revamped the PAPERS-Directory! Awesome, right?

This directory contains a broad range of Papers, several Thesis as well
as other great lecture about IMSI-Catchers, Telecommunication and Hacking.

While the Papers-Collection will be updated by ourselves from time to time
if we find stuff that is worth to be added, you may also send us a request
to add your own stuff here. But please name your files properly and unique.

NOTE: Pull requests will ONLY be accepted if you removed all metadata!


# How to correctly name your file
---------------------------------

* Before naming your file, add its language in square brackets to it.
* Keep the filename as short as possible while still making its content clear.
* Before uploading it, make sure to REMOVE your personal metadata from it!
* And finally, IF you upload it, make sure it is placed in the correct folder.


Example 1: [ENG]-IMSI_Catcher_Specs_2014.pdf
Example 2: [GER]-Diplomarbeit_der_Pozilei.pdf
Example 3: [TUR]-Tez_Doner_GÃ¼zel_Yapar.pdf


# Removing sensitive information
--------------------------------

* Protect yourself and entirely remove all metadata from your file!
* This command will remove all metadata from the files in a folder:

~$ exiftool -r -overwrite_original -P -all= <UPLOAD_FOLDER>

IMPORTANT: Before uploading anything to this directory, make sure it is not
copyrighted in a way that prohibits public sharing. If you ever encounter
the case that you simply don't know, polish your balls and ask the author!

Always remember: Our project is licensed GPL v3+. Keep it tidy and fresh.
