# Removing sensitive information
--------------------------------

* Protect yourself and entirely remove all metadata from your file!
* To remove all metadata from files in a folder, use PDFMtEd Inspector.

PDFMtEd Inspector is a general purpose metadata viewer and cleaner.
Aside from granting a quick and easy insight into the meta information
stored in your files, it also allows you to quickly and effectively
purge all metadata. It is a more secure solution than exiftool alone.
