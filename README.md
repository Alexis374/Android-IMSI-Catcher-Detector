## Android IMSI-Catcher Detector (AIMSICD)

Android-based project to detect and (hopefully one day) avoid fake base stations (IMSI-Catchers) in GSM/UMTS Networks. Sounds cool and security is important to you? Feel free to contribute! ;-)

Unfortunately it seems that IMSI-Catchers have been exponentially popular lately, with an explosion of various "bastards" with governments and criminals all the same, using it. Anyone can now buy an IMSI-Catcher (or build a cheap one on his own). In addition they can all crack the A5.1-3 encryption on the fly! This is why the original author named "E:V:A" started this project. Let's detect and protect against these threats! Never think that you've got "nothing to hide". You'll very likely regret it one day.

* Get scared on YouTube: [How easy it is to clone a phone + call when connected to a femtocell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydo19YOzpzU).
* Also, check out this talk by Karsten Nohl and Luca Melette on [28c3: Defending mobile phones](http://youtu.be/YWdHSJsEOck).

#### Curious? Want to know what IMSI-Catchers can look like?

* This picture has been taken during the riots on Taksim Square in Instanbul:

* Above example is way too conspicuous and you'll likely never encounter one of these.
* Todays IMSI-Catchers can be [body-worn](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/the-body-worn-imsi-catcher-for-all-your-covert-phone-snooping-needs/), or are hidden inside comfortable Spy-Vehicles:

* Todays IMSI-Catchers can be as **tiny** as the portable [Septier IMSI-Catcher Mini](http://www.septier.com/368.html) now:

# Development Roadmap

##### Make an empty "shell" App that:

* a. collects relevant RF related variables using public API calls. (LAC etc)
* b. puts them in an SQLite database
* c. catches hidden SMS's
* d. catches hidden App installations

##### Make another empty "shell" App (or module) that:

* e. opens a device **local** terminal root shell
* f. uses (e.) to connect to the modem AT-Command Processor ATCoP via shared memory interface SHM
* g. displays the results from sent AT commands
* NOTE: This is **crucial** to our project. Please help E:V:A develop a [Native AT Command Injector](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1708598)!

##### [Possibly] Make another App that:

* h. use the OTG (USB-host-mode) interface to use FTDI serial cable to interface with another OsmocomBB compatible phone (using Android host as a GUI host)
* i. uses the "[CatcherCatcher](https://opensource.srlabs.de/projects/mobile-network-assessment-tools/wiki/CatcherCatcher)" detector SW on the 2nd phone
* j. can inject fake 2G GSM location data
* k. find out how to access L0-L2 data using the ATCoP connection
* l. use a statistical algorithm (and smart thinking) on the DB data to detect rogue IMSI catchers
* m. combine all of the above (steps h to l) into a BETA App for testing, add more languages
* n. improve BETA app by adding (many more) things like IMSI-Catcher counter measures

##### Further ideas (none of them for sure yet):

* Add option to make app device administrator
* Add switch to utilize ROOT for digging deeper
* Usage of the [XPosed Framework](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1574401)

# Summary (please read carefully!)

### This project: 

* Detects IMSI based device location tracking
* Provides counter measures against device tracking
* Can provide swarm-wise-decision-based cellular service interruption
* Can provide secure wifi/wimax alternative data routes through MESH-like networking
* Detect and prevent remote hidden application installation
* Detect and prevent remote hidden SMS-based SIM attacks
* Prevent or spoof GPS data
* Does NOT secure any data transmissions
* Does NOT prevent already installed rogue application from full access

### Other projects (NOT this one):

* Provide full device encryption
* Provide secure application sand-boxing
* Provide secure data transmission
* Provide firewalls (awesome solution: [AFWall+](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall))
