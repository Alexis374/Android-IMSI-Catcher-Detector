Welcome to our promotional material!

you may ask us to add your own creations here. Please send us a request via
E-Mail containing your artwork. But please craft any art as neat as possible.

NOTE: Pull requests will ONLY be accepted if you removed all metadata!


# Some important rules for stickers
-----------------------------------

* Use our stickers wisely. Do NOT make our project look silly and childish.
* Do NOT place our stickers above other peoples stuff, respect each other.
* Chose a place where many people pass by where the stickers do not bnother.
* And finally, IF you use our material, avoid getting caught by the police.
