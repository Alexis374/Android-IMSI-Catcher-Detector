# CHANGELOG of 'AIMSICD'
----------------------

#### 06.04.2014

* Applause to [xLaMbChOpSx](https://github.com/xLaMbChOpSx)! He submitted a new [pull request](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/pull/14) and issued a complete rewrite of the menu system, implementing the Actionbar, rewrite of the Device class to perform better and change it from a static class, Persistent notification was added which can be tweaked down the line and the Database helper class was created to provide application wide support.

#### 02.04.2014

* Thanks to the creative work of [SgtObst](https://github.com/SgtObst), we now have FRESH and NEW ICONS for AIMSICD! ;-)

#### 31.03.2014

* New [pull request](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/pull/7) by our awesome developer [xLaMbChOpSx](https://github.com/xLaMbChOpSx)! This one reduces the target SDK version and updates the code.
* Curious to get you hands on something to try out? Bookmark our [WIP-RELEASES](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/releases/) and feel free to [report feedback on XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1422969).

#### 27.03.2014

* A few team members reported that they've been crawled by IP adresses that where not connected to any country (probably   secret agencies) and stalked by members of the famous company Rohde & Schwarz (the leading manufacturer for   
  IMSI-Catchers). We know that with our actions we already have attracked forces out there which get their will through 
  more brutal methods. Thus, we added a small [Disclaimer](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/master/DISCLAIMER). Just to mention it: I always have the latest copy of everything. Enjoy!
