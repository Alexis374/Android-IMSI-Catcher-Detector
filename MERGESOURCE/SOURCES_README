SOURCES OF USEFUL APPS (WHICH WE MIGHT ADD)
===========================================

This file shall provide a short overview of added source code of apps.
NOTE: THIS IS *NOT* A DIRECTORY TO DEVELOP IN, IT'S JUST STUFF TO ADD.
If you add an app to the folder 'MERGESOURCE', please update this file!

IMPORTANT: Get written permission of the app developer to be allowed to
add his source code here first, explicitly point him to our 'LICENSE'!

Formatting example: Date (ddmmyyyy), source code added, developer of app,
link to play store or thread (just to make sure we can track additions).
